										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Every business needs clients. That was a fundamental motto back then and still is today, especially in the digital age where clients can make you a nice profit if you turn the right knobs on autopilot.</strong> However, ecommerce traffic generation is not easy since you’re competing with the entire internet for a limited amount of attention.</p>
<p>If you are successful at increasing your ecommerce traffic numbers, you may become a dominant force that takes all the sales. In order to achieve such a goal, I’m going to show you all you need to know to optimize your numbers to the extreme by answering your burning questions once and for all:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Why your ecommerce traffic is non-existent.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li>What factors determine the amount of visitors on your website.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li>Which are the best ecommerce traffic sources and how to manage them properly.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re reading this, chances are you’ve looked at several other tutorials without getting the results you wanted. This time is different: I’m speaking from experience by working with clients all over the world, creating systems to bring them traffic consistently.</p>
<p>That’s why you should stop whatever you’re doing and focus on fully grasping the contents of this guide, this is the number one guide you need to follow to drive traffic to your online store for free. It’s going to be great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why traffic generation matters?</h2>
<p>Being the first one in Google means having a privileged place in your customers minds. If you are known, if people think of you when they have a necessity or if people find you first, chances are you’ll outsell your competition which adds up in your balance. Nowadays everyone is wondering how to increase ecommerce traffic.</p>
<p>Words like SEO, keywords or CTA are all over the place, and sometimes you don’t even know what they mean. That’s why it’s important to take a good break once in a while to filter out what truly matters for your industry so that you focus on the one thing that brings you the most sales.</p>
<p>A lot of services out there can offer you a good deal of traffic generation in exchange for money, but with this guide you’ll learn to build that traffic just as good or even better as nobody knows your product better than yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Establishing the basics</h2>
<p>To begin with let’s define some of the most popular concepts when it comes to ecommerce traffic generation:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>SEO:</strong> It means Search Engine Optimization which is a set of techniques people use to manipulate search engines like google with the goal of finding your website more easily and rank higher on the search results.</li>
</ul>
<p>The higher you rank and the more search terms are relevant to your website pages, the more visitors you’ll get. This aspect is absolutely key for all ecommerce business since it’s free traffic once setup.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Keywords</strong>: These are specific words people search on the internet when using search engines. Your goal is to identify what terms people are searching for and use them on your website so that search engines bring you traffic to your website by finding your content.</li>
</ul>
<p>They should not be too specific, nor too generic, because either way will end up in your article losing itself among the sea of content in the internet. This means that you need a thorough keyword research every time you write an article on your blog or list a product on your ecommerce store. There are three kinds of keywords to pick up from: short, middle and long tail, the first category being the most popular which brings more people to it while the last one is more precise. Each category has its advantages, and you should plan your keywords according to what your customers are looking for when they search for your product on the internet.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>CTA</strong>: It means Call-To-Action. These are words that incite action to complete the sale. Any “Call now!”, “Register now” or “Book now!” button you see on the internet is a CTA. They must be simple, visually appealing and in harmony with you market and design strategy.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>URL</strong>: A url is the address of a particular page in the internet. The one you find at the top of your browser indicating in what website you are at any given moment. They have to be simple and memorable so that people identify your page easily.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your ecommerce store urls should look like this: yourstore.com/your-product-name. No weird characters, no unnecessary text. Keep it clean and simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step-by-step ecommerce traffic generation</h2>
<p>The key on how to drive traffic to your online store for free is knowing what your client is looking for to then show them what they want as painlessly as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Find topics related to your business</h3>
<p>First brainstorm ideas related to your business. Simply create a text file with words that are relevant to your industry. For instance, if you sell pet accessories for dogs you’ll write “dog accessories”, “dog leashes”, “dog harnesses”, “dog collars”, dog supplies”, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Use data publicly available to your advantage</h3>
<p>Now we become detectives, trying to take a peek inside people&#8217;s minds. It is time for us to look into Wikipedia, into Google and Youtube with the autocomplete function to discover which words people associate or look for when they search for something.</p>
<p>You can also check the “Searches related” section at the end of each google results page, that include similar questions people pose to Google, pointing their interest and making up great keywords to consider. It is the same as with Google suggest.</p>
<p>When you look on wikipedia, at the very “Contents” index you have a sweet guide to what is in people’s minds. Subsections like “Taste”, “Nutrients” or “Consumer safety”. These are fine keywords that are often overlooked. As you can guess, forums are a great deal when it comes to finding keywords. You can find your audience in places like Reddit or specialized forums for each topic by searching for “your industry” + “forum” on google.</p>
<p>You can use this tool <a href="https://www.highervisibility.com/free-seo-tools/keyworddit/">https://www.highervisibility.com/free-seo-tools/keyworddit/</a> to narrow down the keywords on reddit more easily. After you find yourself comfortable with all this you can consider using the Google Keyword planner to boost your traffic.</p>
<p>This one will tell you the visitors you have, the average traffic sources for website that lead them to you and how is each keyword working before you pick it. There are a lot of tools out there to give you keyword ideas such as: ExplodingTopics (for popularity tracking), Ubersuggest, SEMrush (for the keywords that you invest on) and Ahrefs. Be sure to check them out.</p>
<p>Once you finish gathering keyword ideas, it’s time for you to choose which ones you’ll target by writing content with those words. Your decision should be made according to:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Search Volume</strong>: Two factors come into play here, how many people are searching for a specific keyword and how significant that number is in your business sector, because ten thousand searches per month will be nothing to the entertainment industry but massive to the pandemic insurance industry.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Trends</strong>: Along with the search volume a big factor is how trendy a topic is at this present and future moment. You have to think about how relevant the content you write will be in years to come.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Business Fit</strong>: Not every word is about your business. If you try to optimize you content for keywords that have nothing to do with your actual business, you’ll end up losing customers that won’t return back.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Organic Click-Through rate</strong>: This is the difference between what people see and where they click while looking for ecommerce traffic sources. You want people to click on your product listings to get a change for selling your products. The higher this metric the better.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Difficulty</strong>: How difficult is to rank your keyword on search engines? You should not fear being specific but being hard to reach. No difficulty means nobody is looking for it while a massive difficulty is something you want to avoid to save your time.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Tools to make them come back and buy more</h3>
<p>So now you have visitors coming to your website. Most the heavy lifting is done. But how do you keep people longer on your store while spending more money? Start by making their visit more comfortable. Here is a quick list of what can you offer to create a sense of community surrounding your product:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Collaborations</strong>: with other people and brands: Whether if you are already famous or not, working with other personalities and brands can bring you new audiences and facilitate your expansion.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Backlinking</strong>: backlinking is making yourself available through other websites by having an external website link to your store. Try to reach out to blog owners for an agreement.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Social Media</strong>: what better than finding people where they spend most of their time? A nice way to create a community and increase ecommerce traffic is to create and maintain interesting accounts not only on Facebook and Twitter, but also Instagram, Youtube and LinkedIn, the more the better.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Podcasting</strong>: podcasting is on the rise and now any topic can reach a nice little audience that is keen to know who delivers what is best in the business.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Promotions</strong>: Profits may be the fair reward for the ones who care so much about your product. If you already have promotions on your actual store, upload them to your website. If not, you should consider promotions that involve sharing your product.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Newsletters</strong>: They are all over the place now, and your place can make one too! Just gather your news for every other week and keep people looking at what you are offering at the moment.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Internal links</strong>: This is the part to have people busy by the old trick of writing “turn to the next page” on both sides of a paper, but in a more sophisticated manner.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Links are an essential component to increase the time people spend in your website. You want to have links on every article. Internal links to your other articles while also external links to other websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Tools to make them spend more money</h3>
<p>Now that you got a better idea about how to drive traffic to your online store for free and how to make them stick to your page, here are some tips to help you increase your profit margins from your existing customers:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>All roads lead to a sale</strong>: Every post is there to make you money whether that’s indirectly or directly. Thus, you should end your articles with suggested products, to a new collection you may have, or to another relevant article.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Retarget to increase profits</strong>: In ecommerce you can expect low conversion rates such as a 10% of your traffic resulting in a sell. But with tools like “wishlists”, “add to card” and “favourite” you can bring people back to decide the sale later.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Buy right here, with CTAs</strong>: Buying, more than anything has to be easy. Give people the option to buy right there without having to redirect them to an intermediate step so that you don’t lose their patience. Here is where CTAs, shine. Every “Buy now!” at the end of the article is the door to a sell. If you keep the CTAs simple and appealing people are going to reward that by spending more on their visits.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Mind the payment</strong>: Put yourself in the shoes of your client. You have decided to spend money on a product, the least thing you want to do is have trouble working out how do you have to pay.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Payments should be kept simple, quick and suggest related products for up-sales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
