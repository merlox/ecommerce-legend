										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>“Website design inspiration ecommerce”</h1>
<h1>“Never judge a book by its cover”… Greatest lie ever told. It only takes us humans seven seconds to generate an opinion about something or someone, and this also applies to brands.</h1>
<p>Thanks to the internet the proliferation of small brands is rising; now competition is globalized and arduous. Therefore, great questions emerge… How do I stand out amongst my competitors? How do I make a more <strong>creative website design</strong>? How can I enhance my <strong>e-commerce design</strong>?</p>
<p>In this post we will bring you the best <strong>website design inspiration ecommerce</strong> not only on aesthetic terms, but also:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Analyzing and bringing you the most <strong>creative website design inspiration</strong> in UI</li>
	<li>Building a great User Experience</li>
	<li>Brand identity &amp; Content Tips</li>
</ul>
<p>All this with 20 great cases of study from the best <strong>ecommerce design.</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>UI Design… the juicy part</li>
</ol>
<p>Here we will show you the most <strong>creative website design inspiration</strong>. We highlight these designs not because they are simply aesthetically pleasing, but because there’s an analysis process behind them. We highlight the top 10 UI designs based on design tendencies of 2020.</p>
<p>Two things to point out about UI design in 2020:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Empower yourself with the possibilities that technology can offer you</li>
</ul>
<p>BUT!</p>
<ul>
	<li>Keep it simple… remember what architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe once said: “Less is more”.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here you have the top 10 design trends in 10 case of study of <strong>ecommerce design:</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li>Take advantage of the whitespace</li>
</ol>
<p>That it receives the name of whitespace doesn’t mean it’s a white space. Whitespace is the area between the elements on a website (images, typography, icons…).</p>
<p>It balances elements appropriately creating a natural flow for the user to navigate through the content. Thus, making the information easier to digest and letting de website breathe.</p>
<p>Here we give you a great example:</p>
<ul>
	<li><img class="wp-image-221" src="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-36.png" srcset="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-36.png 1347w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-36-1280x588.png 1280w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-36-980x450.png 980w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-36-480x221.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1347px, 100vw" /> Apple</li>
</ul>
<p>The good use of whitespace focalizes the attention of the users and it’s a good tool for CTA. As well, it shows in a pretty spectacular way all the products.</p>

<p>This is an ongoing trend out there and it can work for any kind of ecommerce. It´s frequently used as transition video elements, as a hover state to draw attention on buttons, or to help draw users into the design. THIS UI TREND ONLY WORKS IF THE SPEED OF MOVEMENT IS REALLY FLAWLESS. Make sure that the country for which you’re designing the website has a good bandwidth. Either ways users will leave, and therefore a bad UI design leads to a bad UX. (:</p>

Therefore, a streamlined navigation system creates a direct path to any page of your website, as well as makes a real flowless navigation. Using this kind of navigation system will also let your ecommerce breath and let more room for creativity. Aesthetic illustrations, images, interactive functions or having tons of fun with typography. Here is some outstanding <strong>fashion ecommerce website design</strong>.</p>

<p>As you can see… straight to the point. Almost all the content and categories appropriately condensed in one page.</p>
<p>Here goes another <strong>fashion ecommerce website design.</strong></p>
<p><img class="wp-image-241" src="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-54.png" srcset="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-54.png 1347w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-54-1280x592.png 1280w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-54-980x453.png 980w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-54-480x222.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1347px, 100vw" /></p>

<p>We must say this type of <strong>ecommerce design</strong> is efficient when there are not a lot of categories or products such as this case of study where their only products are socks. This type of <strong>ecommerce design</strong> could not be possible for big platforms such as ASOS.</p>
<p>2. Building a great User Experience</p>
<p>User experience is a key factor in ecommerce. Not paying attention to this has a deep negative impact in sales and other KPI. Consider that the optimal number of clicks to acquire the main product is 3.</p>
<p>If loading time is very long, the user will leave. 4 out of 10 users leave the website if this happens.</p>
<p>If it’s not aesthetic and simple they will abandon the website. First impressions are owned to this with 94%, which is linked to the confidence and credibility, as 75% of times it’s determinant for the purchase.</p>

Sending or receiving funds, as well as making other functions usually requires 2 to 3 clicks. If it wouldn’t be this way, users would abandon the site. EVERYTHING matters when talking about UX: The color palette for example, chosen with great precision to show the CTAs in an adequate way, easing the identification and interpretation for the brain, counting with short, simple and intuitive information modules and showing functionalities in other platforms witch interactive functions.</p>

<ol>
	<li>ASOS</li>
</ol>
<p>ASOS is a grate case of study and therefore an appropriate <strong>website design inspiration ecommerce</strong> in terms of both UI and UX. However, we´re going to analyze this brand as an UX example <strong>of fashion ecommerce website design</strong>.</p>
<p>First, “ethical” brands which reward the user for their purchases and consumption, will be highly rewarded. “Fast brands” such as Zara, H&amp;M or Forever21 have had 6% less visitors in relation to last year. This is due to the great advantages offered by small ecommerce’s.</p>
<p>Let’s see how:</p>
<ul>
	<li>They reward you upon arrival. 30, 50 and 70$ discount in 1 click.</li>
</ul>
<p>This invites the user to continue navigating, search products and purchase them.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-247" src="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-58.png" srcset="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-58.png 1350w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-58-1280x508.png 1280w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-58-980x389.png 980w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-58-480x191.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1350px, 100vw" /></p>
<ul>
	<li>New season products in 1 click.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just below the discount code we can find products from the new season that are just one 1 click away.</p>
<p>We must point out the hover state in the “shop now” button. The color changes in the buttons are essential. This way the user knows that it’s a button and that it is operational.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Videos showing the product. Multimedia content captivates.</li>
</ul>

The greatest concern of any ecommerce is that users abandon their websites.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Realize that Duolingo gives you the option of skipping the registration step. A tedious step for many and that is a reason of leaving an ecommerce.</li>
</ul>
<p>A UX without complications, again straight to the point, which invites you to consume its service straight away. Consider the UX in literally every single step. No matter how good your product is, if your website has a boring and complex UX, consumers will abandon for sure.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Simplicity as a norm. <strong>You</strong> <strong>must know your product</strong>. Drive and focus user’s attention in the areas that needs to be done.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>TopShop</li>
</ol>
<p>Topshop is for sure a great <strong>website design inspiration ecommerce</strong>. It’s a fashion ecommerce with a HUGE catalogue. With MANY things. What does this promote? That users leave on the first chance. Too many options, categories, subpages, etc… TopShop fought against this issue with a UX that fosters the visualization of the content. You don’t even have to click in order to know what awaits you. Just by hovering the cursor you can see what you will find in every category. And prices… prices everywhere. From the beginning you can see 4 USP (Unique Selling Proposition) which invite to consume.</p>
<ul>
	<li>30%OFF</li>
	<li>Free standard delivery on all orders</li>
	<li>Extended returns</li>
	<li>Premier delivery with discount</li>

<p>Another outstanding element is the preview without having to exit the page where you were, making it easier for the user to know if he likes a product or not and the purchase process. This way you assure he will continue to navigate in your ecommerce. Just one click to interact. No long steps.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-271" src="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-82.png" srcset="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-82.png 988w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-82-980x545.png 980w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-82-480x267.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 988px, 100vw" /> <img class="wp-image-272" src="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-83.png" srcset="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-83.png 968w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-83-480x274.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 968px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>It is very important to study the UX of your ecommerce in every page and subpage. If something goes wrong, even a single thing, the most probable outcome is that they will abandon your ecommerce. Thus, analyze, optimize y try to make it as intuitive and interactive as possible.</p>
<p>Last but not least…</p>
<p>3. Brand identity &amp; content tips</p>
<p>One of the <strong>most</strong> important things of any ecommerce. Efficiency of any <strong>creative website design</strong> resides in 2 great pillars: having a solid corporate identity and developing a good content strategy that is aligned with that identity. This implies 3 elements which are key to building a brand:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Having a set of corporate colors <strong>and respecting them</strong></li>
	<li>Having a typography <strong>and respecting it</strong></li>
	<li>Having a voice and communication line <strong>and respecting it</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The difficult thing is not so much having those elements but respecting them in time and with actions. Identity is everything, much more in the world of ecommerce as we only have online channels to meet with our users. Many brands end up doing pretty things (or not) that do not bring:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Homogeneity</li>
	<li>Nor identity</li>
	<li>And therefore, generates confusion within the consumer.</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Organize yourself: Define who you are.</li>
	<li>Who are you looking forward to serving, and what is the purpose of your product? Consider all these variables. You must define these questions to communicate and sell in an appropriate way.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have, it is essential to generate a good branded content, which corresponds with your values and philosophy and above all… be constant. Lack of communication is a death sentence. Thus, don’t stop communicating. Have a presence in social media, send newsletters, generate your own contents in a blog… possibilities are infinite and, executed in a creative way, these are truly attractive.</p>
<p>Here are some case studies:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Airbnb. Airbnb magazine.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Airbnb preaches unique experiences, unforgettable moments, closeness and the discovery of the most mysterious and recondite places which you wouldn’t discover in traditional tourism, thanks to connivance and contact with local population, which in many cases even become touristic guides and friends. Now, how do you convert that in a truly attractive content without making it played-out? Airbnb created Airbnb Magazine.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-274" src="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-85.png" srcset="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-85.png 1334w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-85-1280x598.png 1280w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-85-980x458.png 980w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-85-480x224.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) and (max-width: 1280px) 1280px, (min-width: 1281px) 1334px, 100vw" /> <img class="wp-image-275" src="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-86.png" srcset="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-86.png 786w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-86-480x382.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 786px, 100vw" /></p>
<p>An online magazine with a great variety of articles, where even consumers participate. This way they enhance the value of guests and excellently generate a great content, creating an exceptional word of mouth. But don’t be discouraged, just because your ecommerce is not of the magnitude of Airbnb’s (yet), it doesn’t mean that you can’t do something truly creative. If, for example, you have an ecommerce of online training in stock markets, perhaps you could write a weekly (or even with greater frequency) bulletin with the most relevant economic and financial news, as well as tips on how to invest, setting base on those news. Producing this way useful, consistent and branded content.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-277" src="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-88.png" srcset="https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-88.png 710w, https://ecommerce-legend.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/word-image-88-480x422.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 710px, 100vw" /></p>
<ol>
	<li>Zara. Living Zara</li>
</ol>
<p>Zara has a great <strong>fashion ecommerce website design</strong> that in combination with a branded content strategy has achieved a great positioning and increase in its sales.</p>
<p>Living Zara was a campaign by Zara by the hand of retro, alternative and bohemian influencers with which it managed to bring closer the brand to its consumers.

<p>This way, the brand achieved a great positioning, linking products and publications to their ecommerce, making them easier to find and buy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Every business needs clients. That was a fundamental motto back then and still is today, especially in the digital age where clients can make you a nice profit if you turn the right knobs on autopilot.</strong> However, ecommerce traffic generation is not easy since you’re competing with the entire internet for a limited amount of attention.</p>
<p>If you are successful at increasing your ecommerce traffic numbers, you may become a dominant force that takes all the sales. In order to achieve such a goal, I’m going to show you all you need to know to optimize your numbers to the extreme by answering your burning questions once and for all:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Why your ecommerce traffic is non-existent.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li>What factors determine the amount of visitors on your website.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li>Which are the best ecommerce traffic sources and how to manage them properly.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re reading this, chances are you’ve looked at several other tutorials without getting the results you wanted. This time is different: I’m speaking from experience by working with clients all over the world, creating systems to bring them traffic consistently.</p>
<p>That’s why you should stop whatever you’re doing and focus on fully grasping the contents of this guide, this is the number one guide you need to follow to drive traffic to your online store for free. It’s going to be great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why traffic generation matters?</h2>
<p>Being the first one in Google means having a privileged place in your customers minds. If you are known, if people think of you when they have a necessity or if people find you first, chances are you’ll outsell your competition which adds up in your balance. Nowadays everyone is wondering how to increase ecommerce traffic.</p>
<p>Words like SEO, keywords or CTA are all over the place, and sometimes you don’t even know what they mean. That’s why it’s important to take a good break once in a while to filter out what truly matters for your industry so that you focus on the one thing that brings you the most sales.</p>
<p>A lot of services out there can offer you a good deal of traffic generation in exchange for money, but with this guide you’ll learn to build that traffic just as good or even better as nobody knows your product better than yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Establishing the basics</h2>
<p>To begin with let’s define some of the most popular concepts when it comes to ecommerce traffic generation:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>SEO:</strong> It means Search Engine Optimization which is a set of techniques people use to manipulate search engines like google with the goal of finding your website more easily and rank higher on the search results.</li>
</ul>
<p>The higher you rank and the more search terms are relevant to your website pages, the more visitors you’ll get. This aspect is absolutely key for all ecommerce business since it’s free traffic once setup.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Keywords</strong>: These are specific words people search on the internet when using search engines. Your goal is to identify what terms people are searching for and use them on your website so that search engines bring you traffic to your website by finding your content.</li>
</ul>
<p>They should not be too specific, nor too generic, because either way will end up in your article losing itself among the sea of content in the internet. This means that you need a thorough keyword research every time you write an article on your blog or list a product on your ecommerce store. There are three kinds of keywords to pick up from: short, middle and long tail, the first category being the most popular which brings more people to it while the last one is more precise. Each category has its advantages, and you should plan your keywords according to what your customers are looking for when they search for your product on the internet.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>CTA</strong>: It means Call-To-Action. These are words that incite action to complete the sale. Any “Call now!”, “Register now” or “Book now!” button you see on the internet is a CTA. They must be simple, visually appealing and in harmony with you market and design strategy.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>URL</strong>: A url is the address of a particular page in the internet. The one you find at the top of your browser indicating in what website you are at any given moment. They have to be simple and memorable so that people identify your page easily.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your ecommerce store urls should look like this: yourstore.com/your-product-name. No weird characters, no unnecessary text. Keep it clean and simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Step-by-step ecommerce traffic generation</h2>
<p>The key on how to drive traffic to your online store for free is knowing what your client is looking for to then show them what they want as painlessly as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>1. Find topics related to your business</h3>
<p>First brainstorm ideas related to your business. Simply create a text file with words that are relevant to your industry. For instance, if you sell pet accessories for dogs you’ll write “dog accessories”, “dog leashes”, “dog harnesses”, “dog collars”, dog supplies”, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Use data publicly available to your advantage</h3>
<p>Now we become detectives, trying to take a peek inside people&#8217;s minds. It is time for us to look into Wikipedia, into Google and Youtube with the autocomplete function to discover which words people associate or look for when they search for something.</p>
<p>You can also check the “Searches related” section at the end of each google results page, that include similar questions people pose to Google, pointing their interest and making up great keywords to consider. It is the same as with Google suggest.</p>
<p>When you look on wikipedia, at the very “Contents” index you have a sweet guide to what is in people’s minds. Subsections like “Taste”, “Nutrients” or “Consumer safety”. These are fine keywords that are often overlooked. As you can guess, forums are a great deal when it comes to finding keywords. You can find your audience in places like Reddit or specialized forums for each topic by searching for “your industry” + “forum” on google.</p>
<p>You can use this tool <a href="https://www.highervisibility.com/free-seo-tools/keyworddit/">https://www.highervisibility.com/free-seo-tools/keyworddit/</a> to narrow down the keywords on reddit more easily. After you find yourself comfortable with all this you can consider using the Google Keyword planner to boost your traffic.</p>
<p>This one will tell you the visitors you have, the average traffic sources for website that lead them to you and how is each keyword working before you pick it. There are a lot of tools out there to give you keyword ideas such as: ExplodingTopics (for popularity tracking), Ubersuggest, SEMrush (for the keywords that you invest on) and Ahrefs. Be sure to check them out.</p>
<p>Once you finish gathering keyword ideas, it’s time for you to choose which ones you’ll target by writing content with those words. Your decision should be made according to:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Search Volume</strong>: Two factors come into play here, how many people are searching for a specific keyword and how significant that number is in your business sector, because ten thousand searches per month will be nothing to the entertainment industry but massive to the pandemic insurance industry.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Trends</strong>: Along with the search volume a big factor is how trendy a topic is at this present and future moment. You have to think about how relevant the content you write will be in years to come.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Business Fit</strong>: Not every word is about your business. If you try to optimize you content for keywords that have nothing to do with your actual business, you’ll end up losing customers that won’t return back.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Organic Click-Through rate</strong>: This is the difference between what people see and where they click while looking for ecommerce traffic sources. You want people to click on your product listings to get a change for selling your products. The higher this metric the better.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Difficulty</strong>: How difficult is to rank your keyword on search engines? You should not fear being specific but being hard to reach. No difficulty means nobody is looking for it while a massive difficulty is something you want to avoid to save your time.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Tools to make them come back and buy more</h3>
<p>So now you have visitors coming to your website. Most the heavy lifting is done. But how do you keep people longer on your store while spending more money? Start by making their visit more comfortable. Here is a quick list of what can you offer to create a sense of community surrounding your product:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Collaborations</strong>: with other people and brands: Whether if you are already famous or not, working with other personalities and brands can bring you new audiences and facilitate your expansion.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Backlinking</strong>: backlinking is making yourself available through other websites by having an external website link to your store. Try to reach out to blog owners for an agreement.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Social Media</strong>: what better than finding people where they spend most of their time? A nice way to create a community and increase ecommerce traffic is to create and maintain interesting accounts not only on Facebook and Twitter, but also Instagram, Youtube and LinkedIn, the more the better.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Podcasting</strong>: podcasting is on the rise and now any topic can reach a nice little audience that is keen to know who delivers what is best in the business.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Promotions</strong>: Profits may be the fair reward for the ones who care so much about your product. If you already have promotions on your actual store, upload them to your website. If not, you should consider promotions that involve sharing your product.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Newsletters</strong>: They are all over the place now, and your place can make one too! Just gather your news for every other week and keep people looking at what you are offering at the moment.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Internal links</strong>: This is the part to have people busy by the old trick of writing “turn to the next page” on both sides of a paper, but in a more sophisticated manner.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Links are an essential component to increase the time people spend in your website. You want to have links on every article. Internal links to your other articles while also external links to other websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>4. Tools to make them spend more money</h3>
<p>Now that you got a better idea about how to drive traffic to your online store for free and how to make them stick to your page, here are some tips to help you increase your profit margins from your existing customers:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>All roads lead to a sale</strong>: Every post is there to make you money whether that’s indirectly or directly. Thus, you should end your articles with suggested products, to a new collection you may have, or to another relevant article.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Retarget to increase profits</strong>: In ecommerce you can expect low conversion rates such as a 10% of your traffic resulting in a sell. But with tools like “wishlists”, “add to card” and “favourite” you can bring people back to decide the sale later.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Buy right here, with CTAs</strong>: Buying, more than anything has to be easy. Give people the option to buy right there without having to redirect them to an intermediate step so that you don’t lose their patience. Here is where CTAs, shine. Every “Buy now!” at the end of the article is the door to a sell. If you keep the CTAs simple and appealing people are going to reward that by spending more on their visits.<br />
<br />
</li>
	<li><strong>Mind the payment</strong>: Put yourself in the shoes of your client. You have decided to spend money on a product, the least thing you want to do is have trouble working out how do you have to pay.<br />
<br />
</li>
</ul>
<p>Payments should be kept simple, quick and suggest related products for up-sales.</p>
